            <p>I grew up in Long Beach/Cypress, CA and I started having an interest in computers at the age of 8 years old. My brother and I would mess around with the machine our family had and played the classic mine game or solitaire. It wasn't until I was in my freshman/sophmore year of highschool that I was exposed to programming. I took an HTML course that taught me how to manipulate websites. This allowed me to impress my friends by being able to swag out my Myspace, which was the Facebook of that time. Since then, I have continued my interest in the web and the infinite possibilities that it posseses.</p>

            <p>I am now 27 years old and I live in Newport Beach, CA. My interests have changed but that fire to manipulate the virtual world still keeps me pushing to create something great. For fun I surf, play guitar, and golf. I love to spend time with my family, my girlfriend, my dog, Ollie and my surfing buddies. To this day I still mess around with technology - I've taken apart and put back together laptops and smartphones just to see how they work. My ultimate goal is to create a company that makes this world better than we found it.</p>
